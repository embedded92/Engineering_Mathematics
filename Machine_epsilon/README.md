MACHINE EPSILON-

Machine epsilon deals with rounding in computers.
  ...It is the smallest floating-point number that can be "added to 1.0 with a result that does not round to 1.0".
Machine epsilon varies by machin.
  ...Higher precision computers will have a smaller epsilon.
It is not dependent on a "numbering system". 
  ...Rather, it measures (and demonstrates) the limitations of exact arithmetic using computers.
  ...Computers (and calculators) use a fixed number of bits to perform arithmetic operations. 
  ...This can lead to rounding errors by the computer, either by moving it to another type of computer, dealing with very small numbers, and successive or recursive calculations.
  ...In real math (and simple arithmetic) rounding is not a issue. 
  ...For example, 2/3 = 0.666... . In real math, you can round off 0.666... as you desire, or simply leave it as a repeating decimal (or in this case, a rational number). 
  ...Computers can not store 0.666... in memory or an ALU - it has to be rounded or truncated somewhere!
